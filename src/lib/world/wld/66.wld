The sunken temple courtyard~
The pale light from the open sky pours always into this unsheltered
courtyard, together with the amber glow of standing torches. Many
citizens of the town of Sundhaven find it their pleasure to lounge
here. The dark marble temple rises like a shadow to the north, the
vivid colors of roses eastwards, and the library lies to the west.
There is a stone arch to the south.

The Temple of Mercy~
A myriad of candles, burning brightly in amber hues, illuminate
the black-domed temple. This is where all adventurers of human
ilk must begin their trials of danger and discovery. You stand
in a cast of rosy-gold light, stretching along the floor from
a stained glass window that serves as your first sight of the
known world. The unknown world awaits you with open.. jaws.
There is an inscription in the north wall.

inscription~
The inscription reads:
I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said - "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
I am the Fallen King, Kings of Kings,
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away."

The alms room~
Murals of black and gold adorn the walls in swirling patterns,
within which are outlined several dark silhouettes. Under some
scrutiny you can trace a basilisk, a chimera, and a dragon
circling a deity, a dusty red cloak about her neck. 
Homage and sacrifice to this human deity are paid here by the
other citizens of the realm.

A narrow terrace north of the temple~

Black willows grow in small clusters to the east and west.

town falls behind and the world opens out before you. You are standing
atop a highland cliff, lined with mosses, lichen and purple heather,
and looking out over a foggy wetland. The graveyard for the dead of
Sundhaven lies near the foot of the cliffs, and in the far distance
you can make out the blue line of the sea closing the horizon.

In the shade of old gnarl-limbed elder trees stands the bane of all thieves
and murderers, the platform of the gallows. The dark sand of the road shows
none of the blood that has been shed here, but the legends of the dead live
on in tales and nightmares. The executions still take place at irregular
intervals, to the joy of hidden enemies and law-abiding citizens. You
note there is plenty of room for spectators.
Besides the east-west road, a stone arch stands to the north, and a
well-travelled path leads southwards.

A large room crowded with ornamental porcelain elephants, incense
dishes and silkscreen dividers encloses you, the blur of spicy scents
from the kitchen bringing a flush of red to your face. 
A steep, narrow stairwell rises up the east wall.

The rooftop at Mekala's~
The open, moist air gives some relief from the heat below. Wild
birds circle about above your head, curious about the food but too
shy to descend. A few tables stand adorned with simple white
tablecloths and red candles.

The sparring hall~
Shields and other items of heraldry line the sunken stone walls
of the sparring room, gleaming with human pride. While not being
overly promiscuous, the heads of foes are noticeably stacked one
atop the other on a pole of polished wood in the corner. 
If you are looking to improve your skills in the art of battle,
this might be a good place to start.

The Bread Basket~
You pass into an unusually humble dwelling and shop for the town,
built from baked clay and hot from the cumbersome bread ovens
projecting partially out of the far wall. The smell of fresh
bread is mouth-watering.

The Post Office~
   You narrowly avoid the guillotine-style slash of a rusted axe as you pass
through the doorway of the town post office.  It seems some sort of riot is
underway in here - what would be a strike if this wasn't before unions - among
the numerous disgruntled postal workers conglomerated.  Shining silver letter-
openers flash in the light as they heedlessly try to backstab anyone in sight.
It's a droll scene.  You decide it prudent to mail your wares and be on your
way.
There is a sign posted on the north wall.

Standing at the brink~
A sea of light, floating fog opens up before you, swallowing most
of the cliff and the lands beyond in its pale jaws. Far beyond the
whiteness opens out to reveal a welcome azure that is the mantle
of the sea. A trail disappears downwards into the mist.

This high point on the northern edge of Sundhaven boasts quite a
view. When fog is not seen rolling about the balcony's railing, one
can see the graveyard near the foot of the cliff to the north, and
beyond it, the pearl blue sea, clothing the far horizon. The mages
have made this a favored place for recreational studies.

Your steps echo in a hollow stairwell of naked stone. The air hangs
light and silent about you as a curtain of falling snow, though there
is a chanting taking place, seemingly miles away, in the chamber to
the west. Lamps mounted on the walls give off a silver glow reminiscent
of saints and martyrs, whether they died for the cause of good, or for
evil.

The room of doctrine~
Artifacts and relics from a time before the known world are encased
and illumined in airless, black glass cabinets, their twinkling golden
and silver chasings catching your eye with mocking immortality. Urns
of demon ash line polished amberwood shelves, and a small, simple altar
edged in ivory stands against the north wall.
This is the sanctum of the ministry. Those of a pious bent would do
well to begin studies here.

However, if a god assures you it is safe, it must be.... right?
You trust us, don't you?

Occupied now by only a few spiders, it looks like it could be

of white and red colors. There is a grassy space in the center, circled
by smooth grey stones, where children play and older residents of the
town picnic and enjoy themselves.

The cold wind of the sea blows the sails of the rocking ship they
ride upon. The rogue woman is imploring a second man to destroy
a beast far too great for his strength, a cruel smile playing
upon her lips. 
The image is frozen upon the bark, immobile, yet it is apparent
she is winning the battle. Beneath the picture are engraved the

Along the town wall~
You follow the thick wall of grey cobblestone that marks the
outer border of Sundhaven. Moss, nourished by frequent rainfall,
hides portions of the wall under its green tendrils. A stony
path can be made out to the north, and the wall makes its way
southwards to a corner.

Along the town wall~
You reach a bend in the town wall, and the trail follows it on
both sides to the north and west. Ivy growing along the wall here
brushes your arm as you pass. Dense shrubbery lining the path to
the east renders that way unnavigable.

Along the town wall~
A small path lined with broad trees breaks off to the south from
the cobblestone wall of Sundhaven, which runs eastwards to a corner.
The gate of the town must be somewhere near. You can make out the
buzz of city life, hushed by the stone barrier, from the north.

A path hung with moss~
A narrow path bordered with ancient, broad-trunked trees leads
north to the town wall of Sundhaven and southwards to a short drop.
Moss completely covers and overflows from the oaks, brushing the
hair and helms of all but the shortest races of beings.

A short mossy cliff~
A four foot grey stone cliff, matted with clumps of green moss
and overhung with tall bending trees, is easily scaled by handy
footholds in the rock. The place looks well-travelled by some
hardy population of small-footed creatures.
One path continues in a north-south vein over the cliff, another
breaks off and leads east.

A path hung with moss~
The slender trail winds its way north-south through bending
trees laiden with spanish moss. (Except this was before Spain.)
It comes to an end before the bubbling ebbs of a tiny stream,
pouring gently forth from a hole in the rock on which you are
poised, and flows southward.

A stream~
A quietly flowing stream drifts down a slim riverbed, leading south
from a small hole in the rock to the north. The water is clear and
pure, and seems entirely empty of creatures.. It may be true
this stream was taxed by heavy fishing long ago that long since
cleaned it of all life.

A stream~
The clear waters begin to shift and curl and the current increase
slightly. Tiny brown reeds on the banks lean downstream, sending the
dragonflies airborne from their stalks. A wind whistles in the leaves
of the trees above and no sound can be made out from ahead.

A whirlpool~
A slowly churning blue whirlpool pulls you gently underwater, without
sound and without breath. The tree-darkened sky disappears in a
circular motion above your eyes as the world turns to water, and you
cannot help but feel that what goes down, must continue down..

The waters engulf you and suck you downwards, where you awake with
stars circling before your eyes.

A stairwell~
An old temple stairwell winds down in darkness into the inner, long
abandoned recesses of the golden temple. It seems few have reason
to travel this way. The dust that coats the steps lies mostly
undisturbed, and an aura of desertion hangs about the place.
Whoever does traverse these ancient halls may or may not have
the light of goodness in their motivations.

A dark landing~
A seatless landing creates a pause in the stairwell before its final
descent. Angular shapes of lighter areas on the walls indicate this
place may have once been hung with numerous paintings or tapestries,
possibly comemorating the priests and gods of the past.

A dark corridor~
Shadows seem to creep within the shadows already existing, clashing
and clambering over one another before the approach of your footfalls,
yet everything seems to indicate to you that this is not the sort of
fun fairy-tale niche your mother liked to tell tales about by the
fireside of your ancient home. Do you continue, or turn back? Sometimes
shadows may form a bluff of great danger in the recesses of your
imagination.

A dark corridor~
The corridor halts abruptly. A drop opens out at your feet, beneath
which water shivers and shimmers, black against black. The pool is 
nearly still, only an occasional ripple moving across the surface
gives any indication of life, or life in death, within.
Northwards the hall disappears into the dark.

Edge of a black-bottom pool~
You wade ankle-deep into the murky waters of a black-bottom pool.
It appears this pool was once a nice pleasure bath for the priests
and their guests, but has fallen into decay from recent lack of
use. Who knows what creatures make their home beneath the dark
surface.

A black-bottom pool~
Swamp-like waters black as coal enclose you and wash like cold
slime over every limb, each movement sending a chill coursing
through from ears to toes. The smooth, dark bottom of the pool
shows traces of faded ornamental designs, now mostly hidden and
eroded with moss and algae. Few can pin a name on the grotesque
underwater creatures that now make this their home.

a glass-fronted bookcase displays a variety of map parchments, though

The walls are high enough to keep the town secure, and ringed
with tendrils of lush green ivy. The busy murmur of citylife can
be heard from beyond. Southwards, the cobblestone road crosses
a meadow of sorts before disappearing into a line of dark woods.
