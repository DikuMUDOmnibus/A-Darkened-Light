Up a Twisting Path~
This is a small, rocky path which looks to be heading up the mountain.
The mountain stands high above you, and you have no knowledge of
what lies at the end of the path. It is a very stormy night, with rain 
pouring down and lightning striking in the distance. Thunder claps
and booms as you head up the path hoping for a place to stay until
the storm passes over.

Farther Up the Mountain~
This path is getting muddier than ever! You are now running through mud
puddles, and places where the path is practically gone. By now all of 
your clothes are soaked, and most of your legs are all muddy. 
Ewwwwwwwwwwww!! If you don't get somewhere soon, you're going to 
catch a cold!

At the Top of the Mountain~
Finally you are standing high above the ground, on top of the dreaded 
mountain in the pouring rain. Up ahead looks to be an old house, and 
by now, you don't care what kind of shelter you seek. You begin 
sprinting to the front door, exhausted from traveling up the long path,
and soaked with mud. Suddenly, lightning strikes only a few feet away
from where you were. Unprepared, you almost fall to the mud. Now you
are running as fast as one can go.

the porch that you walk on is creaking with every step, and the 
shudders and the walls look chipped, and just bent out of shape. 
Well, going inside would be better than staying out here in the rain 
all night, wouldn't it?

you very much now. Noises appear from nowhere, and small shadows 
lurk on the walls. Rodent problem, maybe. Every so often lightning

A Room~
As you walk into the room you can sense the evil. It is totally dark inside
here, and you can just see with the light you have. There is a bed laying
turned over in the corner, and boxes have been thrown in another. The
walls are scratched up like some animal went through here. A sword sticks
into the wall nearest you.

The Room of the Golden Lance~
You are in a room with a golden lance sticking up in the middle of it.
The weapon looks rather nice, and would do you greatly. Pick it up
and get out of here fast.

Nearing the End of the Hall~
You are now walking through this hallway, nearing the end of it which is
now south of you a little bit. There are no doors anywhere in this part of
the hallway, but the ones north look pretty interesting. South is the end
of the hallway.

The End of the Hallway~
This is the end of the hallway of the second floor. The rooms are back to
the north if you feel like exploring them again, and a closet lies to the
south with a small door closed. More stairs are to the east, climbing way
up to the attic.

leading up. They look very unstable, like they would break at any moment.
Other than that this room is bare.

Inside the Attic~
You are inside of the attic on the third floor of the house. You REALLY
wouldn't like to find out how old and unstable the wooden boards are up
this high. The attic has lots of old junk in it, mostly covered in old white
sheets, some of them torn. Spider webs drape the corners of the rooms
and hang over some of the stuff laying around.

On the Roof~
You are now on the roof of the old house. The attic must have had a secret
passage leading out here. The night is still very stormy, as you try to walk
as carefully as you can without fatally falling off. That might hurt a little,
don't you agree?

Walking the Roof~
This is another part of the roof of the house. The wind makes you feel
like you are going to be picked up and thrown into the ground at any
moment, so you try to move slowly and steadily. Carefully you make
your way around a section of the roof that is unfinished, and try to
head north.

The Roof~
You are on a part of the roof with a rope ladder hanging down from it
towards the ground. The ground looks so far away, but you'll do anything
to escape from this nightmare. The roof ends by the looks of it...north
of here. The rain is making it very slippery up here, as you can barely
walk without slipping a little.

The End of the Roof~
You are now at the end of the roof, or what once was the roof. The
shingles here have been washed away from the rain, making it look
bare. It's beginning to get very slipper up here. By the looks of it, there
seems to be nowhere to go from here. A small chimney is directly east
of you.

At the Top of the Chimney~
This is the top of a chimney that you're at now. The chimney seems to be
big enough for one to fit in it. It is made of big red bricks which are also
chipped. all over. No smoke is coming up, so why not check out where
it leads?

The Second Floor Balcony~
This is the second floor porch. The rain beats down hard against the
house and the ground, as the lightning flashes and the thunder booms.
The porch is made of wood just like everything else in this dumb old
house. There is a small railing lining the outside of the balcony, so people
don't fall off.

This is the secret den of the owner of this house. An old woman sits here
watching your every move. Blood marks paint the wall along with deep
scratches. The old woman looks to be very old, as in centuries! You try to
smile, but she stands up and releases venom from her huge fangs! Get out
of here and fast!!

Oops!~
You are climbing down the ladder to the ground when all of a sudden a
large gust of wind comes along and hits you hard. Unprepared, you lose
your grip on the very wet ropes, and fly head first into the ground below
you. OUCH!!!!!
