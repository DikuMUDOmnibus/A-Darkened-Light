Wide Road Through the Foothills~
A very well-used roadway leads west into the foothills.  It has been
recently cleared and looks to be a fairly safe direction to take.  To
the east lies the path back toward the main road near Midgaard and
Jareth.

Wide Road Through the Foothills~
The road continues on through the foothills to the east and the west.
On either side of the road are the rolling hills of the area, their
grassy slopes broken only once in a while by trees and bushes.  It is
truly a beautiful area of the world here in the foothills of Jareth.

At the Castle Entry~
The castle door lies west from you, the way in flanked by huge, proud
banners of the Lord and Lady of this place.  Looking off to the east,
you can see why this place might be a nice visit for some of the more
affluent members of society - the rolling hills and the lush scenery
give a very serene, peaceful feeling.

Foyer~
This small, enclosed area holds the many coats and overboots of the
guests here in the Castle.  Doors leading into the interior of the
castle lie on the north, south and west sides.  The door on the east
sides does, of course, lead to the outdoors.

The Lord's State Room~
As if the Lord of this manse would ever truly need a state room and
truly - as if this could even fall under the category of a state room
in any capacity.  Either way, it is the Lord's retreat from his Lady
and from all of the guests when he feels the need and he does feel the
need often.  The fact that there is a small bed in the far corner
means nothing at all...  Does it?

The Lord and Lady's Bedchamber~
The first, and most odd, thing that strikes you upon entry into this
room is that there is not one but two beds set apart from each other.
They are both quite comfortable seeming, but not anywhere near each
other in the room.  Possibly the Lord and his Lady do not enjoy each
other's company as much as they show in public?

of the castle, its domed roof at least a good hundred feet above your
head.  To the north is the grand ballroom, a room used on an almost
nightly basis where the Lord and Lady entertain their guests.  To the
south is the kitchen.  A door lies in the west wall.

The Lord - that sneaky bugger - has a nice in and out way for the

The cooks of the castle labor daily, round the clock, to keep good
eats on the tables in the grand ballroom and here in the kitchen
itself.  It is not uncommon for a stray guest to come shuffling on,
half sleeping and drunk to grab something from the counter or out of
the stove.  The cooks don't mind - that's what they are here for.

Along the Castle Wall~
The wall of the caste runs along your west side, the uneven masonry of
the bricks evident from this close.  To the east and south lie the
wide open foothills which the castle sits in the dead center of, a
beautiful vision of nature.

of land, full of greenery.

A Side Path~
The path ends here, as well as the castle wall.  On the north side of
the path lies a barn, mostly used for the storage of hay and grain to
feed the animals of the guests.  On the west side is the stable where
the animals are kept.

Barn~
It looks as if some of the more raggedy types are given housing out
here in the hay barn - and on a regular basis - while their more
affluent masters stay within the castle.  There is an enormous amount
of hay and grain stacked neatly about the place, some of it made into
comfortable beds.

Wide Road Through the Foothills~
The road continues on through the foothills to the east and the west.
On either side of the road are the rolling hills of the area, their
grassy slopes broken only once in a while by trees and bushes.  Off to
the west, the pennants of a castle can be seen poking above the hill
lines which block your sight.  Obviously, someone owns these lands
upon which you travel and lives just west of here.

Wide Road Through the Foothills~
You come round a slight curve in the roadway and get your first solid
glimpse of the castle which lies only a short span away.  It is a
well-kept place, one which appears to be frequented by many as the
hedges are all neatly trimmed and the banners which fly from the tall
masts on the ramparts and which hang from either side of the grand
entry are fresh and clean.  The roadway runs east and west.

Cold Storage~
The costs involved in maintaining this room is really quite amazing.
Every single day, a man drives his cart out to the frozen sea at the
fringes of the land where the minotaurs rule and brings back with him
huge, solid chunks of ice which are kept here in this sealed room
where all perishable items are kept.
