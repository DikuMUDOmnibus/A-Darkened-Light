hunchback isaac being deformed~
Isaac~
A strange and deformed being stands here tugging on a bell rope.
~
The being before you just happens to be named Isaac, although how
you know that is beyond you, but he is a poor and deaf hunchback,
once hired by the High Priest of the cathedral to ring the bells.
He is quite large, but appears smaller due to his deformity, and
looks to be quite strong.

ghoul corpse-like being~
the ghoul~
A strange corpse-like being is here attacking a man in black robes!
~
This being looks like a long dead and dessicated human corpse.  Its
neat translucent skin is taut about its bones and you think you can
see strange little white movements underneath it.

esmerelda priestess woman~
Esmerelda the priestess~
A woman dressed in dark robes watches the approaching undead in fear.
~
Dressed in solid black, Esmerelda is the current High Priestess of this
Cathedral.  Funny how you had never heard of a female high priestess
before this time, isn't it?  And even stranger, you know her name...
how distinctly odd.  Anyways, Esmerelda seems to be watching the undead
before her advancing ever so slowly, maybe you can try to save her!

priest man~
the man~
A man, dressed in black and silver robes, is fighting off some undead!
~
This man is wearing a black and silver robe and is swinging a mace made
of what looks to be obsidian.  He seems to be sorely beset by the undead
before him.

wyrenthoth dracolich dragon undead~
Wyrenthoth~
It is on this ledge that Wyrenthoth sits, preening him... itself.
~
Hmmm... seems that you have managed to walk in on Wyrenthoth during one
of his... its preening sessions.  You don't exactly understand what there
is to see beyond the bones.  Oh, wait, you didn't even know what the
thing in front of you was did you?  Well, you take the time to look, for
once, and notice that it is a large collection of bones.  And it just so
happens that this large collection of bones serves to form what looks to
be a dragon, although the odd bone or two seems to be out of place.  It
does appear that Wyrenthoth is a dracolich.

vampire erich man~
Erich~
A pale white man dressed in a black stands before you.
~
The man before you is dressed in all black except for his cape which
has a red satin lining.  He has dark hair and cold green eyes that
catch and reflect every movement.  Erich, as his name happens to be,
is the master vampire in control of all of the evil undead which
infest this cathedral.

giant zombie~
the giant zombie~
A rather large zombie is lumbering about here, quite aimlessly.
~
The zombie giant seems to be wandering around crushing those who
oppose the... it.  It is an enormous mass of rotting flesh and
filth that smells, to put it bluntly, really bad.

skeleton human~
the human skeleton~
A skeletal human is standing here, looking rather confused.
~
You look upon this being with a good deal of curiosity.  Then it
begins to twitch, and looks around.  You are rather shocked, until
you realize that it seems to be looking for someone in particular.

zombie corpse~
the zombie~
A corpse is standing upright here, wandering these halls.
~
The thing before you is a rotting corpse, complete with flesh
falling off of it in small chunks.  It is dressed in the remains
of a peasant's clothing and seems to have a single purpose in
mind (not that its mind could probably handle any more than that).

shadow~
the shadow~
A shadow made of inky blackness moves along the wall towards you.
~
The moving shape of blackness looks like it is a shadow that
lost its owner at some point.  It looks rather malignant.  To
put it mildly.

wight~
the wight~
A hideous creature is here, mere skin and bones, howling madly.
~
This ghastly apparition fills you with nigh-absolute terror.  Your
first conscious thought is to run.  Run fast and far that is.
However, your second thought is to look at it a little more closely.
In doing so, you notice that it seems to be made of mummified flesh,
stretched over pointed bones.  Also, it has strangely glowing red
eyes.

the wraith~
A strange humanoid shape moves towards you.  It is a wraith!
~
This thing looks vaguely humanoid, but does not appear to be made
of flesh but rather seems to be made of a strange electricity in
the air.

banshee form humanoid mother superior~
the banshee~
A strange humanoid form stands in one corner of the room, singing.
~
The once beautiful complexion of this female has deteriorated under the
ravages of time and decay, leaving only a pale resemblence to the former
living elf.  Looking closely at the clothing she wears, you notice that
it appears to be the soul of the cathedral's Mother Superior.

ghost abbott~
the ghost of the Abbott~
A portly ghost is sitting on an ethereal bed, singing softly to himself.
~
This lost soul looks like he was once the Abbott of the cathedral.
he is a portly fellow and even though he is long since dead, he looks
rather jovial.  When you look at him, he stops singing for a minute,
looks up at you, smiles sadly, and then continues his song.
