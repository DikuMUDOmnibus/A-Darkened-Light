A giant white kestrel is perched near its master.
~
The kestrel's plumage is pale as lamb's down, making it a beautiful
animal, but the sharp curved beak and arched talons remind you
of its predatory habits. A tiny metal ring is clasped round one
leg.. it must be someone's pet.

athos knight warrior~
Athos~
Athos the great knight is somberly nursing a bottle of wine.
~
Athos wears a face of sorrow on his noble countenance, displaying
only a few quiet words of philosophy when his tongue is loosened
by drink. His dress depicts a man of learning and his voice one
of some foul experience. Something - or someone - still haunts
him to this day.
