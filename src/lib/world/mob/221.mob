the woman in pink~
A woman wearing a pretty pink taffeta dress trudges along the beach.

  My, what beauty. But she just gives you a long, doleful stare and without
a sound continues along. How strange--her eyes are a very dull grey. Doesn't
seem to work with her beautiful face.

leader harem master~
a fat harem master~
A very fat harem master orders his concubines around.
~
  Gads. This man must have some kind of magic to be able to keep all of these
women, because he certainly doesn't have the face for it. He looks somewhat
like a cross between a pear and a potato, but without the good looks.

A small, red crab scuttles along the beach.

the Priest of Fear~
The Priest of Fear is walking around, looking rather pompous.
~
  This incredibly strong person doesn't look like the kind of man you'd want to
meet on the street every day. He certainly inspires fear in your heart. You'd
most likely *NOT* want to attempt to kill this man! He's one mean fellow!

the prisoner~
A prisoner, locked up for crimes against Fear, is raving here.
~
  The prisoner looks at you bravely and shouts, "JUST KILL ME! I DARE YOU!"
He looks totally emaciated, as if he hasn't been fed for weeks. He is dirty
and almost naked--his rags barely cover him. He is covered in his own filth.
Just looking at him makes you want to retch.

terror high priest~
the High Priest of Terror~
The High Priest of Terror stands before you in all her majesty.
~
  How shocking! Out of all the types of people you would expect to see in this
kind of position, you didn't expect to see someone this beautiful and kind-
looking. She stands about 2 meters tall, and while she is obviously very 
strong, she is also quite voluptious. She looks at you with the most 
sympathetic eyes--you just want to give yourself over to her.

dragon terror~
the Grand Dragon of Terror~
The Grand Dragon of Terror rests, curled around a giant pillar in the temple.
~
  This dragon is just beautiful. Its scales are mirror-like in polish.
Beautifully-coloured wings protrude from the sides. Unlike most dragons,
this actually resembles a snake--except that it's about one-hundred times
larger, and certainly is more dangerous. Sharp teeth extend from the mouth,
and wisps of smoke curl from its nose. It looks at you with infinite
intelligence and a little bit of resignation, as though it knows you will
eventually get around to attacking it.

the air with a mad cackle, and looks at you. With an evil grin, he says,
"ah, my next victim! yessssss" and launches himself at you.

out of you--whether you know it or not.
