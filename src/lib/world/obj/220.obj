corpse fresh~
The corpse lying here is disgusting at best.  Looking closely at it, you
notice that it has been disembowled, but can find no trace of the entrails
whatsoever.

E
altar~
The altar before you is covered with glyphs and symbols that mean nothing
to you.  It obviously is not the original altar that was in this cathedral.
There are fresh blood stains down the side of it and the top is stained a
very deep brown.

You stare at the shiny white surface of this key, noticing strange

key is made not of ivory, but rather of bone.  Erk.

The coins look to be quite pretty.  The pile before you isn't that

it is 'mid-sized'.

Like that wasn't expected.  They have all been splintered and most

This has got to be the largest weapon you have ever seen.  Sure, halberds
are normally big, but this has got to be at least twice as big as any other
halberd you've seen.  How any mortal can even hope to use it, you are not
sure, but it is definitely something you wouldn't want to get hit by....
