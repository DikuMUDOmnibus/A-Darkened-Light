&WWelcome To A Darkened Light
&y---------------------------&w

Welcome, fellow immortal, to A Darkened Light. The game, at this present
time, is currently running in Beta_testing. Feel free to report any bugs
/ideas/typos ...etc to the Implementors. Donathin and Mayhem are greatful
to have you on board, and hope to design a fun and detailed game.

If you have any building questions, type handbook. This command will show
you most everything there is to know about building. If you want to apply
for a different position, insted of building, talk to Donathin or Mayhem. 
The show zone command displays a list of the zones, which are currently 
within the game. Again, for any other help on building, see the handbook 
or type help OLC.

If you have a zone idea in mind, run it by an implementor first. It is a
must that it fits the theme here. Try to stay within the fantasy theme, 
and not venture off into technology. If you are a builder here, please 
build. Do not wonder around the game and kill mobs for fun, this takes 
off valueble building time and puts you in a place that you would not 
like to be in.
