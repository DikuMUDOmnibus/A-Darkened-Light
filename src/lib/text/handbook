The text is not yet finished so these are rough rules you should follow and
you will happy and honorable member of Immortal Staff of VisionMUD:

1) Immortals MAY give quests to mortals, especially if they're asked. The
   quest rewards should be balanced to the quest difficulty and the
   capabilities of heroes.

2) Immortals MAY help (and should :) help newbies (< level 4) to look around 
   in the mud and help them with orientation in their hometown and to help
   them in their first fight.

3) Immortals MAY punish player if they break repetitively POLICIES in 
   suitable manner.

4) Immortals MAY NOT help higher level players (>3) in any way (Summoning,
   casting beneficial spells, grouping with them, assisting them, donating
   powerful items). In special cases there is permitted to not follow this
   rule (e.g. special quest, which cannot be fulfilled without using some
   special item), but it's your responsibility to make equal condition to each 
   player and to maintain balance of the game.

5) Immortals MAY NOT harm players (without reason) in any way (attacking, 
   casting harmful spells, freezing, bugging etc.). Some of these may be
   used for disciplinary purposes.

6) Immortals MAY NOT use their privileges (wizard commands, etc.) to
   endanger running of the mud, for example by sending excessive amounts of
   input, executing time consuming commands repetitively.    

The breaking of rules (especially repetitive), will be punished by demoting
or immediate deletion. 
Final words:

             YOU HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH POWER - USE IT WISELY
